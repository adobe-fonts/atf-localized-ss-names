**NOTE**: Most of the localized strings will be grammatically incorrect, because very little
effort was put into accurately translating them from the English. Nevertheless, these pseudo
translations should provide a good proxy for real-world localized strings.

The script `featureNamesWriter.py` is provided for easily converting the strings from 
Unicode-encoded text into feature-file escaped character codes.
